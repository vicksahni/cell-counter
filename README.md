# cell-counter

Counts cells in a calcium imaging movie. Currently in a very rudimentary stage, GUI refinements and added features coming soon!

<u>**How to run:**</u>

Clone or download the repo, and follow the instructions for your respective platform.

Mac/Linux: Enter the following into your Terminal.
`python main.py`

Windows: Enter the following into Command Prompt.
`py main.py`

<u>**TODO:**</u
- Add more documentation
- Integrate breadth-first search from previous code
- Link to ImageJ for tracking photoswitching index
- Optimize runtimesâ€”there are currently too many unnecessary loops
- Create executables/applications for each platform (Mac .app/Windows .exe\*) for command-line averse users
